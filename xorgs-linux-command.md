"xargs" is used to execute a command, passing constructed argument list(s). The arguments are typically a long list of filenames (generated by ls or find etc) that are passed to xargs via a pipe.

Some features:

- xargs can execute the command supplying some initial arguments directly, and reading the remaining arguments from standard input (or piped input).
- xargs passes arguments to command in several bundles, this allows command to process more arguments than it could normally handle at once.
- Arguments in the standard input must be separated by unquoted blank characters, or unescaped blank characters or newline characters.
- Characters can be quoted by enclosing them in "double-quotes" (non-double-quote and non-newline chars only).
- Characters can be quoted by enclosing them in 'apostrophes' (non-apostrophe and non-newline chars only).
- Any unquoted character can be escaped by preceding it with a backslash.
